    <h1>We've all been through this</h1>
    <hr>
    <p><em>Do you feel <strong>anxious</strong>? Do you think you've reached the threshold and there is <strong>no future</strong> ahead? Here's my journey, each and every moment of the worst phase of my life and how i'm still struggling hard to get
        out of it!</em></p>
  </center>
  <p>
    Let's get started with who i am and why do i sound so depressed? Believe me or not i'm the happiest person on the face of earth. Ask me a reason for it? A successful career? A beautiful woman? The secret of my happiness is nothing but the lessons
    i learned and the changes i'm still making to become a better person, someone who could handle any situation maturely without any fear. I've failed in choosing my career path, I've failed in my relationship, I've failed to my friends and family,
    but what i have with me is the courage to still face like and make changes. I promise as we proceed and interact through this journey, i won't give up and you won't either. Togethor, we'll face the world and conquer our emotions. We've all faced
    or still facing severe emotional outbreaks, i definitely can't say i have a cure to all problems, but i am guranteeing my presence no matter how worse things get. All i want is you to be by my side too. Deal?

    <h3>Why Heal Thy Soul?</h3>
  </center>
  <p>
    I cant handle the toxicity from the content people share on instagram, facebook and other social media platforms. A person can have any mood at any point of time and one relatable post could trigger so hard that you may loose the purpose
    completely. This made me think about establishing a user friendly platform where like minded people could share their emotions, laugh togethor, party togethor, cry togethor and fear togethor. Why do you need to know each other for sharing what
    holds
    you within?
    <br>
    <br>
    So here's Heal Thy Soul for you. A confidential confession platform for however you feel. I know times maybe tough but what makes it easy are people who've faced it and the fact that they've got your back. If we start talking, it stays between us
    forever ‚ù£
